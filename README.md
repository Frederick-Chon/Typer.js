# Typer.js

Typer.js is a simple speed typing game where users type the words seen on the DOM as quickly as possible. Users will be able to select between 3 difficulty modes which determine how much time is added after each correct word. The goal of this project is to get more practice with DOM manipulation and how to implement a simple timer using setInterval().
